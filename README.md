# Platform Integration with Mapbox Native SDK - Android

This project contains example code for integrating with the Mapbox Native SDK for Android. The project
will get a list of the latest contoured radar mosaic frames and animate them in the Mapbox widget.

Open the file:

```java
com.wdtinc.mapbox_platform_client.MainActivity.java
```

Modify the constants to include your API keys:

```java
private static final String MAPBOX_API_KEY = "";
private static final String PLATFORM_HOST = "skywise-tiles.api.wdtinc.com";
private static final String PLATFORM_PORT = "80";
private static final String PLATFORM_USERNAME = "";
private static final String PLATFORM_PW = "";
```
